# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: first application

This is the first application that I made as I was learning Ruby on rails using the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).
It only has basic functions but I hope to add more as I learn. I will be sharing what I learn through my [*blog*](http://techiepot.com)
